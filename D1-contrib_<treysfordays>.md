Looking Back In Retrospec:

Overall I felt we had a rough time with delverable due to our lack of planning. As a result we started late
and did not really have a clear idea of how far we should have progressed through each week. Our lack of
organization also hurt us in terms of dividing tasks. As we didn't go into detail of what each main function
needed to do step by step, we didn't really know how hard each task was to complete causing some inequality
in terms of amount of work assigned. One thing I thought went well for us was our communication. We were
constantly updating each other on our progress and troubles that we were facing. In the next derliverable
we'll definitly focus more on specs and splitting up big tasks in to many small ones. Hopefully that will
make splitting tasks easier and make us more aware of our progress.
