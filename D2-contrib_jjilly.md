Retrospective: Albeit we were stuck with a timeout bug from d1 for the first week of d2 we preformed in an effective manner for the following
weeks. I feel even though our communication is good, the readability of our code is a bit lacking which hindered the efficiency of each others work.
Going forward I hope to refactor and write code so it is more readable.
