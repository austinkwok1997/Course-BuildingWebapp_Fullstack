Looking Back In Retrospec:

I think a big hurdle that we faced in d1 was the fact that we couldn't get autotest running within 5 minutes.
As a result, we didn't get any feedback from the bot's test. I felt once we got past that problem and could see
the autobot's results we started to make progress at a much faster pace.
